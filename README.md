# Omarchy - Tailored for Fedora

## Difference with Omarchy
- Tailored for Fedora
- Replace `yay` calls with `dnf`
- Remove support for NVIDIA driver, I don't have laptop with NVIDIA, sorry
- Keep the login screen
- Remove ruby installation, I use nix and devbox for development environment

Turn a fresh Fedora installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern web development system based on Hyprland by running a single command. That's the one-line pitch for Omarchy (like it was for Omakub). No need to write bespoke configs for every essential tool just to get started or to be up on all the latest command-line tools. Omarchy is an opinionated take on what Linux can be at its best.
